## Overview

**Jellyfin MonWUI Plugin**, displayed in Jellyfin as **JMSFusionV2**, is an all-in-one frontend enhancement layer built around a modular slider system located in `Resources/slider/`.

Rather than applying a single visual modification, JMSFusionV2 expands the Jellyfin Web experience across home screen presentation, metadata, hover interactions, profile management, music playback, pause behavior, library discovery, notifications, and centralized UI configuration.

The project was designed to make Jellyfin feel more polished, personal, and cinematic while keeping the interface cohesive.

---

## Client Compatibility

JMSFusionV2 works by injecting JavaScript and CSS into the **Jellyfin Web UI**.

### Compatible clients

* Web browsers using Jellyfin Web
* Mobile clients that embed the Jellyfin Web interface, including:

  * **Jellyfin for Android**
  * **Jellyfin for iOS**

### Not compatible

* **Jellyfin for Android TV**
* Native TV clients that do not load the server's `jellyfin-web` frontend
* Other clients using an independent native interface

In short, if a client does not render the server's `/web/index.html`, JMSFusionV2 cannot modify its interface.

Because the project is archived, compatibility with newer Jellyfin server or client releases is not guaranteed.
